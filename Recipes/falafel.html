    <h1>Chef John's Falafel</h1>
    <p>Unlike most of America's other favorite fast foods,
    falafel is rarely attempted at home, which is a shame,
    since it's very simple to do, and even a relative novice like me 
    can get some very decent results. 
    One word of warning: you do need to know you're going to 
    have a craving for this a full day before you actually 
    want to eat it.</p>

    <h2>How to make Falafel</h2>
    <p>You will find a full step-by-step recipe below</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water;
        let stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.</li>
        <li>Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda,       
        and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, 
        until mixture is finely ground and holds together when pressed. Transfer garbanzo mixture to a bowl, 
        cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with moistened hands into a ball.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. 
        Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    </ol>
